ðŸ§  fMRI Blind Spots: Finding Brain Regions That Stay Silent

This project explores "blind spots" in the brain â€” regions that do *not* activate across both motor and language tasks. Using open-access fMRI datasets and Nilearn, we visualize areas of the brain that remain consistently inactive, which could hint at specialized or underexplored regions.

ðŸ“Š What This Notebook Does
- Loads motor and language fMRI activation maps
- Identifies regions with zero activation in both tasks
- Visualizes the "silent" areas as brain blind spots

ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Run all cells â€” no setup needed!
3. See the brain maps with highlighted blind spots.

ðŸ›  Built With
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
Inspired by cognitive neuroscience questions on whether certain brain regions remain underactivated across tasks â€” potentially specialized for yet-unknown functions!
